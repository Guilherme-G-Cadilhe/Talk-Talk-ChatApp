<h2 id="Learned" align="center">‚òï What have i learned?</h2>

> With this project i was able to further advance my **Technical Skills and Knowledge** with **Electron** and understand how to **communicate between its Render(FrontEnd) and Main(BackEnd)** to make Api's calls and receive its response on the Render.<br>
> I also learned how to **easily customize and setup a Electron Enviroment capable of using any Framework by reading JS Source Maps generated by Webpack and its Configs**.<br>
> Practiced how to **Create Custom Menu for the Application, and a Custom Loading View before the App is fully loaded**.<br>
> Used it's **Notification api** to create a custom option settings that communicates user's connection status by emiting events between its Render and Main server.<br>
> **Practiced Good Electron Patterns and Structuring**.<br>
> Got to understand how to **Integrate Webpack and Babel with Electron**.<br>
> I learned how to **setup and configure Electron Builder, to Generate and Publish Electron Apps**.<br>
> Got to understand how to **utilize Firebase's Realtime Database to subscribe to events on the database**, and utilize this as a leverage to **build the Dynamic Messaging System on the Chats**.<br>
> Inspired me to abandon Redux and **Learn Zustand from sratch and Integrate it on the Project**, Adapting it to every Redux situation. And learning to love this minimalistic library<br>
> Also did a **Secondary Electron App** that integrates **ChatGPT** and uses **Typescript** too, along with **Electron-Forge** instead of Electron-Builder, to **Build and Publish the new App**<br>
